# Event-Alarm
I had created a Python tool called Event Alarm which enables users to set several alerts for various occurrences. It offers a practical approach to organize and keep track of significant events and the associated alarm times.
## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Install all the modules/libraries imported in code using pip
3. Open the terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
4. Follow the prompts to enter the event names and alarm times.
5. Once the alarms are set, the script will continuously check the current time and ring the alarms when the alarm times are reached.
6. When an alarm rings, you can press 'x' to stop the alarm or 's' to snooze it for 5 minutes.
